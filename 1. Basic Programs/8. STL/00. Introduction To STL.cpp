// STL : Standard Template Library. it is a powerful set of C++ template class.

/*
components in STL :
1. containers : It is used to manage collections of object of certain kind.
e.g. : arrays,linked list,trees etc.
vectors :it can be used for creating dynamic arrays of any data type.

2. Algorithms : It acts on containers. it performs various complex algorithms
on containers like initialization, sorting, searching & trnsforming.

3. Iterators : It is used to iterate the elements of collections of objects.
it may be containers or subset of container. it is used to point to containers.
it actually acts as a bridge between containers & algorithms.
