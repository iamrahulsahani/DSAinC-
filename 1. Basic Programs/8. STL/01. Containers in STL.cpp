associative containers : sorted data structures like map, set.
unordered associative containers : unsorted data structure.
containers adapters : interfaces to sequence containers.

/*
common containers :-
vector : replicates arrays.
queue : replicates queue.
stack : replicates stack.
priority_queue : replicates heap.
list : replicates linked list.
set : replicates trees.
