/*
class : A class is a blueprint of object.
object : An object is an instance of a class.

Principles of OOP's:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritence
4. Polymorphism

Note : By default everything is private in c++.

ways of creating objects in c++:
Human h; //stack
Human *h = new Human(); //heap
Human *h = new Human; //heap

ways of using members:
for stack:-
h.introduce();
for heap:-
h->introduce();

Types of functions in a class:
constructors: Rectangle();
mutator : setLength();
accessor : getLength();
facilitators : area();
enquiry : isSquare();
destructor : ~ Rectangle();

Note : The declarations of functions should be inside class & it's
definition should be outside of class.
